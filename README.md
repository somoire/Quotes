# Quotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.


## Description
The webapp contains allows one to post a quote using the form and vote on other posted quotes displayed on the side.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The github page is currently live thus the following link will take you to the webpage "https://rsquotes.netlify.com/"
* As long as you have a compatible browser the document will work.
* Or else one can simply fork the repo ang for as long as one has a working code editor, eithe Visual Basic or atom, one can view the code.
Fork the repo into a well organized folder structure and open the folder on your terminal.
Once open in the terminal, one can input the following command: [ $ ng serve --open ]. This will then refer you to your browser from where you can see the web app and input your own quotes.

### Bugs
Form can submit empty values and can't be reset.

### Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return "Input Title" when the user leaves a form value empty.<br> 
Input Example:" "<br>
Output Example: "Author is required

* When the user places the cursor on either the 0 values in the details, on clicking on either of the two, the value should increase by 1.<br>
Input Example:(click "0")<br>
Output Example: Like = +1<br>

* When the user click on "Add Quote" the values entered in the form should be displayed on the right side.<br>
Input Example: Title=Me, Author=You, Quote= Us<br>
Output Example: Me, You, Us

* When the "Delete" button is clicked the parent quote will be deleted.

* The title form is more dependent on the category of the quote. Whether love, life or any other categorical quote depending on what the submitter really wants to input.



### Technologies Used
* HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.
* CSS was used in styling the document.
* Visual studio was the source code editor of choice.
* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* Netlify was majorly used for deployment purposes.
* AngularCLI was used in creating the components/classes/directives/pipes needed in the web-app
